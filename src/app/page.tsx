              Building the simplest backend in the world
            </h1>

            <h2 className="title is-4">There are no “easy backends”</h2>
            <p>
              Let's imagine that you have a web app, built with React or
              something similar, and you need to implement a simple backend
              feature to make it less static.
            </p>
            <p>
              How would you do it ? A quick internet search and you suddenly
              need to learn about different databases, runtimes, infrastructure
              and so on.. The amount of skills and energy needed for a simple
              backend implementation is ridiculously high.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you ask that question to 10 backend developers, they will
              probably come up with 10 different stacks. Why ? Because there is
              no straightforward way to create a backend.
            </p>

            <h2 className="title is-4">
              Aren't no-code tools the solution to simplify backends ?
            </h2>

            <p>
              No-code tools are great for people that do not know how to code.
            </p>
            <p>
              What is the added value when you can do it faster by coding ? Not
              that much. Moreover all of those solutions generate an awful code
              that is hard to validate and maintain, especially when working
              with a team.
            </p>

            <h2 className="title is-4">Our journey to rethink the backend</h2>
            <p>
              We strongly think that the backend can be simpler and more
              inclusive. We also think that this can be done without a
              perceptible performance drop, and more importantly, without
              trading off our love for coding properly.
            </p>

            <p>Here are some statements that we believe in:</p>

            <h3 className="title is-6">Simple code over no code</h3>
            <p>
              We are looking for the simplest and more minimalist syntax
              possible. We do not want to trade off professionalism for
              simplicity.
            </p>

            <h3 className="title is-6">Inclusive rather than powerful</h3>
            <p>
              Making a backend easy to learn and use is the key. A perfect
              backend should be appealing even for frontend developers with no
              backend experience.
            </p>

            <h3 className="title is-6">Cloud-based equals lock-in</h3>
            <p>
              Even if Open Source, cloud-based apps revoke your ownership and
              impose vendor lock-in by design. A truly free tool should be made
              for your machine first.
            </p>
