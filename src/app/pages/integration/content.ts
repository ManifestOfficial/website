    body: `<p><strong>React is a highly popular front-end framework.</strong> Developed and maintained by Facebook (now Meta), React was first released in 2013 and quickly gained popularity in the developer community.</p>

    <p>It offers a blend of performance, reusability, and flexibility. Its widespread adoption and strong community support make it a top choice for developers building interactive web applications.</p>
    
    <h2 class="title is-2">Why would you need a backend for your React app?</h2>
    At some point, a backend is mandatory for implementing critical features:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Get dynamic data: </strong>You have to deal with dynamic data that will change over time.</li>
        <li><strong>CRUD operations: </strong>CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. You may want to enable your users to create and manage their own content.</li>
        <li><strong>User authentication: </strong>This involves implementing user authentication (logins, sign-ups) and authorization (access controls) for your resources.</li>
        <li><strong>File and image storage: </strong>Handling file uploads, storage, and retrieval.</li>
        <li><strong>Server-side functions: </strong>You may want to add server-side logic like sending emails or other functions that cannot be done through the client and need a secure environment.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="title is-2">What is CASE?</h2>
    CASE is a lightweight backend-as-a-service that deploys a full backend in one-command with everything you need without configuration:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Database</li>
        <li>REST API</li>
        <li>Admin Panel</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why is CASE the best backend to use with ReactJS?</h2>
    <p>Combining <strong>CASE and ReactJS</strong> gives you many advantages:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong><span class="is-highlighted mr-1">CASE is easy to use as React: </span></strong> CASE follows React's philosophy. It is accessible, simple, and highly expandable.</li>
        <li><strong class="is-highlighted mr-1">Use the JS SDK: </strong>Use the CASE JS SDK in React to access <strong>backend functions</strong> such as lists, filters, upload, creation, login/logout...</li>
        <li><strong class="is-highlighted mr-1">Nothing to configure: </strong>The backend, often a complex realm with many components, is simplified with CASE as there is nothing to configure.</li>

    <li><strong>CRUD Functionalities: </strong>CRUD refers to the processes of Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting. Facilitate user engagement by allowing them to generate and control their content.</li>
    <li><strong>Implementing User Access: </strong>This requires setting up systems for user sign-ins and registrations, along with managing permissions for accessing your resources.</li>
    <li><strong>Management of Files and Images: </strong>Focus on the upload, storage, and access of files and images.</li>
