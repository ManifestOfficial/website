    body: `<p><strong>React is a highly popular front-end framework.</strong> Developed and maintained by Facebook (now Meta), React was first released in 2013 and quickly gained popularity in the developer community.</p>

    <p>It offers a blend of performance, reusability, and flexibility. Its widespread adoption and strong community support make it a top choice for developers building interactive web applications.</p>
    
    <h2 class="title is-2">Why would you need a backend for your React app?</h2>
    At some point, a backend is mandatory for implementing critical features:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Get dynamic data</strong><br>
        You have to deal with dynamic data that will change over time.</li>
        <li><strong>CRUD operations</strong><br>
        CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. You may want to enable your users to create and manage their own content.</li>
        <li><strong>User authentication</strong><br>
        This involves implementing user authentication (logins, sign-ups) and authorization (access controls) for your resources.</li>
        <li><strong>File and image storage</strong><br>
        Handling file uploads, storage, and retrieval.</li>
        <li><strong>Server-side functions</strong><br>
        You may want to add server-side logic like sending emails or other functions that cannot be done through the client and need a secure environment.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="title is-2">What is CASE?</h2>
    CASE is a lightweight backend-as-a-service that deploys a full backend in one-command with everything you need without configuration:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Database</li>
        <li>REST API</li>
        <li>Admin Panel</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Why is CASE the best backend to use with ReactJS?</strong><br>
    Combining CASE and ReactJS gives you many advantages:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>CASE is easy to use as React<br>
        CASE follows React's philosophy: accessible, simple, and highly expandable.</li>
        <li>Use the JS SDK<br>
        Use the CASE JS SDK in React to access backend functions such as lists, filters, upload, creation, login/logout...</li>
        <li>Nothing to configure<br>
        The backend, often a complex realm with many components, is simplified with CASE as there is nothing to configure.</li>
    </ul>
